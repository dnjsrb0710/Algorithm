 afghanistan economy

overview 
 fundamentally afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly
 dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and
 goats economic considerations however have played second fiddle to
 political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war including
 the nearly 10 year soviet military occupation which ended 15 february
 1989 over the past decade one third of the population fled the country 
 with pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and iran about 1 3
 million another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within
 afghanistan although reliable data are unavailable gross domestic product
 is lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
 disruption of trade and transport

 albania economy

overview 
 the albanian economy already providing the lowest standard of living in
 europe contracted sharply in 1991 with most industries producing at only a
 fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at 40 for over
 40 years the stalinist type economy has operated on the principle of
 central planning and state ownership of the means of production albania
 began fitful economic reforms during 1991 including the liberalization of
 prices and trade the privatization of shops and transport and land reform 
 these reform measures were crippled however by the widespread civil
 disorder that accompanied the collapse of the communist state following
 their overwhelming victory in the 22 march 1991 elections the new
 democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
 economy and establish a market economy in an effort to expand international
 ties tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former soviet
 union and the us and has joined the imf and world bank the albanians have
 also passed legislation allowing foreign investment albania possesses
 considerable mineral resources and until 1990 was largely self sufficient
 in food however the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general
 economic decline forced albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
 supplies available statistics on albanian economic activity are rudimentary
 and subject to an especially wide margin of error

 algeria economy

overview 
 the oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy algeria
 depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts about 30 of
 government revenues and nearly 25 of gdp in 1973 74 the sharp increase in
 oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
 program of industrialization plunging oil and gas prices combined with the
 mismanagement of algeria s highly centralized economy has brought the
 nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
 1988 the government has promised far reaching reforms including
 privatization of some public sector companies encouraging private sector
 activity boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports and proposing a major
 overhaul of the banking and financial systems but to date it has made only
 limited progress

 andorra economy

overview 
 the mainstay of andorra s economy is tourism an estimated 13 million
 tourists visit annually attracted by andorra s duty free status and by its
 summer and winter resorts agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
 of arable land and most food has to be imported the principal livestock
 activity is sheep raising manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes 
 cigars and furniture the rapid pace of european economic integration is a
 potential threat to andorra s advantages from its duty free status

 angola economy

overview 
 subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80 90 of the
 population but accounts for less than 15 of gdp oil production is vital
 to the economy contributing about 60 to gdp in recent years a bitter
 internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy and food has to be
 imported for the long run angola has the advantage of rich natural
 resources in addition to oil notably gold diamonds and arable land to
 realize its economic potential angola not only must secure domestic peace
 but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
 imbalances throughout the economy

 argentina economy

overview 
 argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population 
 an export oriented agricultural sector and a diversified industrial base 
 nevertheless following decades of mismanagement and statist policies the
 economy has encountered major problems in recent years leading to
 escalating inflation and a recession during 1988 90 since 1978 argentina s
 external debt has nearly doubled to 58 billion creating severe debt
 servicing difficulties and hurting the country s creditworthiness with
 international lenders elected in 1989 president menem has implemented a
 comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
 argentina s economic decline and putting it on a path of stable sustainable

 armenia economy

overview 
 armenia under the old centrally planned soviet system had built up textile 
 machine building and other industries and had become a key supplier to
 sister republics in turn armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
 and energy from the other republics most of these supplies enter the
 republic by rail through azerbaijan 85 and georgia 15 the economy has
 been severely hurt by ethnic strife with azerbaijan over control of the
 nagorno karabakh autonomous oblast a mostly armenian populated enclave
 within the national boundaries of azerbaijan in addition to outright
 warfare the strife has included interdiction of armenian imports on the
 azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
 armenians in nagorno karabakh an earthquake in december 1988 destroyed
 about one tenth of industrial capacity and housing the repair of which has
 not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
 disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
 ussr administrative apparatus among facilities made unserviceable by the
 earthquake are the yerevan nuclear power plant which had supplied 40 of
 armenia s needs for electric power and a plant that produced one quarter of
 the output of elevators in the former ussr armenia has some deposits of
 nonferrous metal ores bauxite copper zinc and molybdenum that are
 largely unexploited for the mid term armenia s economic prospects seem
 particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
 dependence on outside areas themselves in a chaotic state of

 austria economy

overview 
 austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
 proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits thanks
 to an excellent raw material endowment a technically skilled labor force 
 and strong links to german industrial firms austria occupies specialized
 niches in european industry and services tourism banking and produces
 almost enough food to feed itself with only 8 of the labor force in
 agriculture improved export prospects resulting from german unification and
 the opening of eastern europe boosted the economy during 1990 and to a
 lesser extent in 1991 gdp growth slowed from 4 9 in 1990 to 3 in 1991 
 mainly due to the weaker world economy and is expected to drop to around
 2 in 1992 inflation is forecasted at about 4 while unemployment probably
 will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993 living
 standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of western
 europe problems for the l990s include an aging population the high level
 of subsidies and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
 capabilities austria which has applied for ec membership was involved in
 ec and european free trade association negotiations for a european economic
 area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
 goods services capital and labor within the ec

 azerbaijan economy

overview 
 azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either armenia or georgia 
 the other transcaucasian states it resembles the central asian states in
 its majority muslim population high structural unemployment and low
 standard of living the economy s most prominent products are cotton oil 
 and gas production from the caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
 for several years with foreign assistance the oil industry might generate
 the funds needed to spur industrial development however civil unrest 
 marked by armed conflict in the nagorno karabakh region between muslim
 azeris and christian armenians makes foreign investors wary azerbaijan
 accounts for 1 5 to 2 of the capital stock and output of the former soviet
 union although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
 civil strife lack of economic reform political disputes about new economic
 arrangements and the skittishness of foreign investors azerbaijan s
 economic performance was the best of all former soviet republics in 1991
 largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output

 bangladesh economy

overview 
 bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world the economy is based
 on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products such as jute 
 which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings and rice 
 bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources population
 growth of more than 2 a year large scale unemployment and a limited
 infrastructure furthermore it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters 
 despite these constraints real gdp growth averaged about 3 5 annually
 during 1985 89 a strong agricultural performance in fy90 pushed the growth
 rate up to 6 2 and fy91 saw further though smaller increases in output 
 alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government s
 development strategy

 barbados economy

overview 
 a per capita income of 6 500 gives barbados one of the highest standards of
 living of all the small island states of the eastern caribbean 
 historically the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
 related activities in recent years however the economy has diversified
 into manufacturing and tourism the tourist industry is now a major employer
 of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange the economy
 slowed in 1990 91 however and bridgetown s declining hard currency
 reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
 austere economic reform program

 belarus economy

overview 
 in many ways belarus resembles the three baltic states for example in its
 industrial competence its higher than average standard of living and its
 critical dependence on the other former soviet states for fuels and raw
 materials belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former soviet
 republics producing 4 of the total gdp and employing 4 of the labor
 force once a mainly agricultural area it now supplies important producer
 and consumer goods sometimes as the sole producer to the other states 
 the soil in belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of ukraine but by
 emphasizing favorable crops and livestock especially pigs and chickens 
 belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat milk 
 eggs flour and potatoes belarus produces only small amounts of oil and
 gas and receives most of its fuel from russia through the druzhba oil
 pipeline and the northern lights gas pipeline these pipelines transit
 belarus enroute to eastern europe belarus produces petrochemicals 
 plastics synthetic fibers nearly 30 of former soviet output and
 fertilizer 20 of former soviet output raw material resources are limited
 to potash and peat deposits the peat more than one third of the total for
 the former soviet union is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
 electric power stations and in the production of chemicals the potash
 supports fertilizer production

 benin economy

overview 
 benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
 limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure agriculture
 accounts for about 35 of gdp employs about 60 of the labor force and
 generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings the industrial sector
 contributes only about 15 to gdp and employs 2 of the work force low

 bolivia economy

overview 
 the bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between 1980 and 1985 as la paz
 financed growing budget deficits by expanding the money supply and
 inflation spiraled peaking at 11 700 an austere orthodox economic
 program adopted by then president paz estenssoro in 1985 however succeeded
 in reducing inflation to between 10 and 20 annually since 1987 eventually
 restarting economic growth since august 1989 president paz zamora has
 retained the economic policies of the previous government keeping inflation
 down and continuing moderate growth nevertheless bolivia continues to be
 one of the poorest countries in latin america with widespread poverty and
 unemployment and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its
 limited exports agricultural products minerals and natural gas 
 moreover for many farmers who constitute half of the country s work force 
 the main cash crop is coca which is sold for cocaine processing

 bosnia and herzegovina economy

overview 
 bosnia and herzegovina ranked next to macedonia as the poorest component in
 the old yugoslav federation although agriculture has been almost all in
 private hands farms have been small and inefficient and the republic
 traditionally has been a net importer of food industry has been greatly
 overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of communist central planning
 and management tito had pushed the development of military industries in
 the republic with the result that bosnia hosted a large share of
 yugoslavia s defense plants as of april 1992 the newly independent
 republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
 production to plummet unemployment and inflation to soar and human misery
 to multiply the survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
 is in doubt both serbia and croatia have imposed various economic blockades
 and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups 
 these areas contain most of the industry if a much smaller core muslim
 state survives it will share many third world problems of poverty 
 technological backwardness and dependence on historically soft foreign
 markets for its primary products in these circumstances other muslim
 countries might offer assistance

 botswana economy

overview 
 the economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops 
 agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80 of the population 
 but produces only about 50 of food needs the driving force behind the
 rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry 
 this sector mostly on the strength of diamonds has gone from generating
 25 of gdp in 1980 to over 50 in 1989 no other sector has experienced such
 growth especially not agriculture which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils the unemployment rate remains a problem at 25 although diamond
 production remained level in fy91 substantial gains in coal output and
 manufacturing helped boost the economy

 brazil economy

overview 
 the economy with large agrarian mining and manufacturing sectors entered
 the 1990s with declining real growth runaway inflation an unserviceable
 foreign debt of 122 billion and a lack of policy direction in addition 
 the economy remained highly regulated inward looking and protected by
 substantial trade and investment barriers ownership of major industrial and
 mining facilities is divided among private interests including several
 multinationals and the government most large agricultural holdings are
 private with the government channeling financing to this sector conflicts
 between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
 violence the collor government which assumed office in march 1990 is
 embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
 reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices deregulating the economy 
 and opening it to increased foreign competition the government in december
 1991 signed a letter of intent with the imf for a 20 month standby loan 
 having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
 during 1989 and 1990 brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
 in talks on the reduction of medium and long term debt and debt service
 payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears a major
 long run strength is brazil s vast natural resources

 bulgaria economy

overview 
 growth in the lackluster bulgarian economy fell to the 2 annual level in
 the 1980s by 1990 sofia s foreign debt had skyrocketed to over 10 billion
 giving a debt service ratio of more than 40 of hard currency earnings and
 leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments 
 the post communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
 industrial plant coping with worsening energy food and consumer goods
 shortages keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments 
 investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric power from
 nuclear energy reached over one third in 1990 and motivating workers in
 part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises bulgaria s
 new government led by prime minister filip dimitrov is strongly committed
 to economic reform the previous government even though dominated by former
 communists had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
 planning system bringing the economy back into balance and reducing
 inflationary pressures the program produced some encouraging early results 
 including eased restrictions on foreign investment increased support from
 international financial institutions and liberalized currency trading 
 small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small

 burma economy

overview 
 burma is a poor asian country with a per capita gdp of about 500 the
 nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
 earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports 
 for rice traditionally the most important export the drop in world prices
 has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales in
 1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
 position the economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector which
 generates about 40 of gdp and provides employment for 65 of the work
 force burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
 and has been trying to encourage foreign investment so far with little
 success

 burundi economy

overview 
 a landlocked resource poor country in an early stage of economic
 development burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
 industries its economic health depends on the coffee crop which accounts
 for an average 90 of foreign exchange earnings each year the ability to
 pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
 climate and the international coffee market as part of its economic reform
 agenda launched in february 1991 with imf and world bank support burundi
 is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
 investment in industry several state owned coffee companies were privatized
 via public auction in september 1991

 cambodia economy

overview 
 cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
 stymied by deadly political infighting the economy is based on agriculture
 and related industries over the past decade cambodia has been slowly
 recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval the food
 situation remains precarious during the 1980s famine was averted only
 through international relief in 1986 the production level of rice the
 staple food crop was able to meet only 80 of domestic needs the biggest
 success of the nation s recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
 and in fishing industry other than rice processing is almost nonexistent 
 foreign trade has been primarily with the former ussr and vietnam and both
 trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
 ussr statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable 
 foreign aid from the former ussr and eastern europe has virtually stopped

 cameroon economy

overview 
 because of its offshore oil resources cameroon has one of the highest
 incomes per capita in tropical africa still it faces many of the serious
 problems facing other underdeveloped countries such as political
 instability a top heavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate
 for business enterprise the development of the oil sector led rapid
 economic growth between 1970 and 1985 growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
 precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports coffee 
 cocoa and petroleum export earnings were cut by almost one third and
 inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed in 1990 92 with support
 from the imf and world bank the government has begun to introduce reforms
 designed to spur business investment increase efficiency in agriculture 
 and recapitalize the nation s banks nationwide strikes organized by
 opposition parties in 1991 however undermined these efforts

 17 year drought and a high birthrate the economy is service oriented with
 commerce transport and public services accounting for 65 of gdp during
 the period 1985 88 although nearly 70 of the population lives in rural
 areas agriculture s share of gdp is only 16 the fishing sector accounts
 for 4 about 90 of food must be imported the fishing potential mostly
 lobster and tuna is not fully exploited in 1988 fishing represented only

 remittances from emigrants and foreign aid economic reforms launched by the
 new democratic government in february 1991 are aimed at developing the
 private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy

 resources potential make chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
 the world its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war conflict
 with libya drought and food shortages in 1986 real gdp returned to its
 1977 level with cotton the major cash crop accounting for 48 of exports 
 over 80 of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing 
 industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural
 products including cotton sugarcane and cattle chad is highly dependent
 on foreign aid with its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from
 shortages oil companies are exploring areas north of lake chad and in the
 doba basin in the south since coming to power in december 1990 the deby
 government has experienced a year of economic chaos

 chile economy

overview

 retain the orthodox economic policies of pinochet although the share of
 spending for social welfare has risen slightly in 1991 growth in gdp
 recovered to 5 5 led by consumer spending after only 2 1 growth in 1990 
 the tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation from
 27 3 in 1990 to 18 7 in 1991 despite a 12 drop in copper prices the
 trade surplus rose in 1991 and international reserves increased

 china economy

overview 
 beginning in late 1978 the chinese leadership has been trying to move the
 economy from the sluggish soviet style centrally planned economy to a more
 productive and flexible economy with market elements but still within the
 framework of monolithic communist control to this end the authorities have
 switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
 the old collectivization increased the authority of local officials and
 plant managers in industry permitted a wide variety of small scale
 enterprise in services and light manufacturing and opened the foreign
 economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures the most gratifying
 result has been a strong spurt in production particularly in agriculture in
 the early 1980s industry also has posted major gains especially in coastal
 areas near hong kong and opposite taiwan where foreign investment and
 modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export goods aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978 on the
 darker side the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
 worst results of socialism bureaucracy lassitude corruption and of
 capitalism windfall gains and stepped up inflation beijing thus has
 periodically backtracked retightening central controls at intervals and
 thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process in 1991 output rose
 substantially particularly in the favored coastal areas popular
 resistance changes in central policy and loss of authority by rural cadres
 have weakened china s population control program which is essential to the
 nation s long term economic viability

 colombia economy

overview 
 economic development has slowed gradually since 1986 but growth rates
 remain high by latin american standards conservative economic policies have
 kept inflation and unemployment near 30 and 10 respectively the rapid
 development of oil coal and other nontraditional industries over the past
 four years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices colombia s
 major export the collapse of the international coffee agreement in the
 summer of 1989 a troublesome rural insurgency and drug related violence
 have dampened growth but significant economic reforms are likely to
 facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term these reforms center on
 fiscal restraint trade liberalization and privatization of state utilities
 and commercial banks

 comoros economy

overview 
 one of the world s poorest countries comoros is made up of several islands
 that have poor transportation links a young and rapidly increasing
 population and few natural resources the low educational level of the
 labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity high
 unemployment and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
 assistance agriculture including fishing hunting and forestry is the
 leading sector of the economy it contributes about 34 to gdp employs 80 
 of the labor force and provides most of the exports the country is not
 self sufficient in food production and rice the main staple accounts for
 90 of imports during the period 1982 86 the industrial sector grew at an
 annual average rate of 5 3 but its contribution to gdp was only 5 in
 1988 despite major investment in the tourist industry which accounts for
 about 25 of gdp growth has stagnated since 1983 a sluggish growth rate of
 1 5 during 1985 90 has led to large budget deficits declining incomes and
 balance of payments difficulties preliminary estimates for 1991 show a
 moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports tourism 
 and government investment outlays

 congo economy

overview 
 congo s economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts a
 beginning industrial sector based largely on oil supporting services and a
 government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing a reform
 program supported by the imf and world bank ran into difficulties in
 1990 91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
 a heavy debt servicing burden oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
 of the economy providing about two thirds of government revenues and
 exports in the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled congo to
 finance large scale development projects with growth averaging 5 annually 
 one of the highest rates in africa during the period 1987 91 however 
 growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1 5 annually only half the

 cook islands economy

overview 
 agriculture provides the economic base the major export earners are fruit 
 copra and clothing manufacturing activities are limited to a
 fruit processing plant and several clothing factories economic development
 is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
 of natural resources and good transportation links a large trade deficit is
 annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid 
 current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
 and expanding the fishing industry

 croatia economy

overview 
 before the political disintegration of yugoslavia the republic of croatia
 stood next to slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area with
 a per capita output roughly comparable to that of portugal and perhaps
 one third above the yugoslav average serbia and the serb dominated army of
 the old yugoslavia however have seized croatian territory and the
 overriding determinant of croatia s long term economic prospects will be the
 final border settlement under the most favorable circumstances croatia
 will retain the dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
 slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land even so croatia
 would face monumental problems stemming from the legacy of longtime
 communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage during
 the fighting to bridges factories powerlines buildings and houses and
 the disruption of economic ties to serbia and the other former yugoslav
 republics at the minimum extensive western aid and investment especially
 in the tourist and oil industries would seem necessary to salvage a
 desperate economic situation however peace and political stability must
 come first

agriculture 
 croatia normally produces a food surplus most agricultural land in private
 hands and concentrated in croat majority districts in slavonia and istria 
 much of slavonia s land has been put out of production by fighting wheat 
 corn sugar beets sunflowers alfalfa and clover are main crops in
 slavonia central croatian highlands are less fertile but support cereal
 production orchards vineyards livestock breeding and dairy farming

 cuba economy

overview 
 the economy centrally planned and largely state owned is highly dependent
 on the agricultural sector and foreign trade sugar provided about
 two thirds of export revenues in 1991 and over half was exported to the
 former soviet republics the economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
 that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace abolished
 farmers informal produce markets and raised prices of government supplied
 goods and services in 1990 the economy probably fell 5 largely as a result
 of declining trade with the former soviet union and eastern europe recently
 the government has been trying to increase trade with latin america and
 china cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982 the
 government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
 and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former soviet
 union other investment priorities include sugar basic foods and nickel 
 the annual soviet subsidy dropped from 4 billion in 1990 to about 1
 billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for cuban sugar and a sharp
 decline in soviet exports to cuba the former soviet republics have
 indicated they will no longer extend aid to cuba beginning in 1992 instead
 of highly subsidized trade cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
 in convertible currencies because of increasingly severe shortages of
 fuels industrial raw materials and spare parts aggregate output dropped
 by one fifth in 1991

overview 
 the greek cypriot economy is small diversified and prosperous industry
 contributes 24 to gdp and employs 35 of the labor force while the service
 sector contributes 44 to gdp and employs 45 of the labor force rapid
 growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
 have played important roles in the average 6 4 rise in gdp between 1985 and
 1990 in mid 1991 the world bank graduated cyprus off its list of
 developing countries in contrast to the bright picture in the south the
 turkish cypriot economy has less than half the per capita gdp and suffered a
 series of reverses in 1991 crippled by the effects of the gulf war the
 collapse of the fruit to electronics conglomerate polly peck ltd and a
 drought the turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion dollar grant
 from turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis turkey normally
 underwrites a substantial portion of the trnc economy

 denmark economy

overview 
 this modern economy features high tech agriculture up to date small scale
 and corporate industry extensive government welfare measures comfortable
 living standards and high dependence on foreign trade denmark probably
 will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and
 monetary policies and export oriented growth prime minister schluter s
 main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
 off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze public sector
 expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit the rate of growth by
 1993 boosted by increased investment and domestic demand may be
 sufficient to start to cut denmark s high unemployment rate which is
 expected to remain at about 11 in 1992 low inflation low wage increases 
 and the current account surplus put denmark in a good competitive position
 for the ec s anticipated single market although denmark must cut its vat
 and income taxes

 djibouti economy

overview 
 the economy is based on service activities connected with the country s
 strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast africa 
 djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
 international transshipment and refueling center it has few natural
 resources and little industry the nation is therefore heavily dependent
 on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects an unemployment rate of over 30 continues to be a
 major problem per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 over the last
 five years because of recession and a high population growth rate including

 increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
 source of new jobs agriculture remains a key sector of the economy the
 principal commercial crop is sugarcane followed by coffee cotton cocoa 
 and tobacco domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
 products durable consumer goods minerals and chemicals unemployment is
 officially reported at about 30 but there is considerable underemployment

overview 
 ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas growth
 has been uneven because of natural disasters for example a major
 earthquake in 1987 fluctuations in global oil prices and government
 policies designed to curb inflation the government has not taken a
 supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment although
 its agreement to enter the andean free trade zone is an encouraging move as
 1991 ended ecuador received a standby imf loan of 105 million which will

 egypt economy

overview 
 egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the third world
 economies most industrial plants being owned by the government 
 overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment 
 even so the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s but
 in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
 debt servicing led egypt to begin negotiations with the imf for
 balance of payments support as part of the 1987 agreement with the imf the
 government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation promote
 economic growth and improve its external position the reforms have been
 slow in coming however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
 past four years the addition of 1 million people every seven months to
 egypt s population exerts enormous pressure on the 5 of the total land area
 available for agriculture

 estonia economy

overview 
 starting in july 1991 under a new law on private ownership small
 enterprises such as retail shops and restaurants were sold to private
 owners the auctioning of large scale enterprises is now in progress with
 the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership that is 
 estonian or the commonwealth of independent states can be established 
 estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former soviet
 republics agriculture is well developed especially meat production and
 provides a surplus for export only about one fifth of the work force is in
 agriculture the major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
 capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products
 from the other former soviet republics these manufactures are of high
 quality by ex soviet standards and are exported to the other republics 
 estonia s mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil 60 
 of old soviet total and phosphorites 400 million tons estonia has a
 large relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
 needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants like the other 14
 successor republics estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional
 period between a collapsed command economic structure and a
 still to be built market structure it has advantages in the transition not
 having suffered so long under the soviet yoke and having better chances of
 developing profitable ties to the nordic and west european countries

 ethiopia economy

overview 
 ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in africa its
 economy is based on subsistence agriculture which accounts for about 45 of
 gdp 90 of exports and 80 of total employment coffee generates 60 of
 export earnings the manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector over 90 of large scale industry but less
 than 10 of agriculture is state run the government is considering selling
 off a portion of state owned plants favorable agricultural weather largely
 explains the 4 5 growth in output in fy89 whereas drought and
 deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in fy90 in 1991
 the lack of law and order particularly in the south interfered with
 economic development and growth

 falkland islands islas malvinas economy

overview 
 the economy is based on sheep farming which directly or indirectly employs
 most of the work force a few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
 consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those
 for providing winter fodder exports feature shipments of high grade wool to
 the uk and the sale of postage stamps and coins rich stocks of fish in the
 surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders so far 
 efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful in
 1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the falklands exclusive fishing zone these license fees
 amount to more than 40 million per year and are a primary source of income
 for the government to encourage tourism the falkland islands development
 corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
 wildlife and trout fishing

 faroe islands economy

overview 
 the faroese who have long been enjoying the affluent living standards of
 the danes and other scandinavians now must cope with the decline of the
 all important fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
 annual income when the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s the faroese no longer could continue
 their traditional long distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
 nearby fishing areas the government s tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a recession and subsidy cuts will force
 further reductions in the fishing industry which has already been plagued
 with bankrupcies an annual danish subsidy of 140 million continues to
 provide roughly one third of the islands budget revenues

 fiji economy

overview 
 fiji s economy is primarily agricultural with a large subsistence sector 
 sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange and sugar processing
 accounts for one third of industrial output industry including sugar
 milling contributes 13 to gdp fiji traditionally had earned considerable
 sums of hard currency from the 250 000 tourists who visited each year in
 1987 however after two military coups the economy went into decline gdp
 dropped by 7 8 in 1987 and by another 2 5 in 1988 political uncertainty
 created a drop in tourism and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
 production to fall sharply in contrast sugar and tourism turned in strong
 performances in 1989 and the economy rebounded vigorously in 1990 the
 economy received a setback from cyclone sina which cut sugar output by an

 finland economy

overview 
 finland has a highly industrialized largely free market economy with per
 capita output nearly three fourths the us figure its main economic force is
 the manufacturing sector principally the wood metals and engineering
 industries trade is important with the export of goods representing about
 30 of gdp except for timber and several minerals finland depends on
 imported raw materials energy and some components of manufactured goods 
 because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining
 self sufficiency in basic commodities the economy which experienced an
 average of 4 9 annual growth between 1987 and 1989 sank into a deep
 recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6 2 the recession which is
 expected to bottom out in late 1992 has been caused by economic
 overheating depressed foreign markets and the dismantling of the barter
 system between finland and the former soviet union in which soviet oil and
 gas had been exchanged for finnish manufactured goods the finnish
 government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
 efficiency by an increase in exports to western markets cuts in public
 expenditures partial privatization of state enterprises and foreign
 investment and exchange liberalization helsinki tied the markkaa to the
 ec s european currency unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue
 the markkaa by about 12 in november 1991 the devaluation should improve
 industrial competitiveness and business confidence in 1992 finland as a
 member of efta negotiated a european economic area arrangement with the ec
 that allows for free movement of capital goods services and labor within
 the organization as of january 1993 finland applied for full ec membership

 france economy

overview 
 one of the world s most developed economies france has substantial
 agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector 
 large tracts of fertile land the application of modern technology and
 subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
 western europe france is largely self sufficient in agricultural products
 and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products the industrial sector
 generates about one quarter of gdp and the growing services sector has
 become crucial to the economy after expanding at a rapid 3 8 pace during
 the period 1988 89 the economy slowed down in 1990 with growth of 1 5 in
 1990 and 1 4 in 1991 growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2 the
 economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
 labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate which rose to almost 10 
 in 1991 the steadily advancing economic integration within the european
 community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
 sectors

 besides the french space center at kourou fishing and forestry are the most
 important economic activities with exports of fish and fish products
 mostly shrimp accounting for more than 60 of total revenue in 1987 the
 large reserves of tropical hardwoods not fully exploited support an
 expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export cultivation
 of crops rice cassava bananas and sugarcane are limited to the
 coastal area where the population is largely concentrated french guiana is
 heavily dependent on imports of food and energy unemployment is a serious
 problem particularly among younger workers

 gabon economy

overview 
 the economy dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s is now
 dominated by the oil sector during the period 1981 85 oil accounted for
 about 46 of gdp 83 of export earnings and 65 of government revenues on
 average the high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial
 increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand reinforced
 migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to
 among the highest in sub saharan africa the three year slide of gabon s
 economy which began with falling oil prices in 1985 was reversed in 1989
 because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows in 1990 the
 economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes but debt servicing
 problems are hindering economic advancement the agricultural and industrial
 sectors are relatively underdeveloped except for oil

note 
 the war between israel and the arab states in june 1967 ended with israel in
 control of the west bank and the gaza strip the sinai and the golan
 heights as stated in the 1978 camp david accords and reaffirmed by
 president bush s post gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of
 the west bank and the gaza strip their relationship with their neighbors 
 and a peace treaty be tween israel and jordan are to be negotiated among the
 concerned parties camp david further specifies that these negotiations will
 resolve the respective boundaries pending the completion of this process 
 it is us policy that the final status of the west bank and the gaza strip
 has yet to be determined in the us view the term west bank describes all
 of the area west of the jordan river under jordanian administration before
 the 1967 arab israeli war with respect to negotiations envisaged in the
 framework agreement however it is us policy that a distinction must be
 made between jerusalem and the rest of the west bank because of the city s
 special status and circumstances therefore a negotiated solution for the
 final status of jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
 rest of the west bank 
 the gaza strip is currently governed by israeli military authorities and
 israeli civil administration it is us policy that the final status of the
 gaza strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties 
 these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed

 gaza strip economy

overview 
 in 1990 roughly 40 of gaza strip workers were employed across the border by
 israeli industrial construction and agricultural enterprises with worker
 remittances accounting for about one third of gnp the construction 
 agricultural and industrial sectors account for about 15 12 and 8 of
 gnp respectively gaza depends upon israel for some 90 of its external
 trade unrest in the territory in 1988 92 intifadah has raised
 unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of gazans the
 persian gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to gaza
 since august 1990 worker remittances from the gulf states have plunged 
 unemployment has increased and exports have fallen dramatically the area s
 economic outlook remains bleak

 georgia economy

overview 
 among the former soviet republics georgia is noted for its black sea
 tourist industry its large output of citrus fruits and tea and the amazing
 diversity of an industrial sector that accounted however for less than 2 
 of the ussr s output another salient characteristic of the economy has been
 a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics almost 30 
 of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18 in industry mineral
 resources consist of manganese and copper and to a lesser extent 
 molybdenum arsenic tungsten and mercury except for very small quantities
 of domestic oil gas and coal fuel must be imported from neighboring
 republics oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from azerbaijan to
 the port of batumi for export and local refining gas is supplied in
 pipelines from krasnodar and stavropol georgia is nearly self sufficient
 in electric power thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
 thermal power stations the dismantling of central economic controls is
 being delayed by political factionalism marked by armed struggles between
 the elected government and the opposition and industrial output seems to
 have fallen more steeply in georgia in 1991 than in any other of the former
 soviet republics to prevent further economic decline georgia must
 establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
 soviet republics while developing new links to the west

 germany economy

overview 
 the federal republic of germany is making substantial progress in
 integrating and modernizing eastern germany but at a heavy economic cost 
 western germany s growth in 1991 slowed to 3 1 the lowest rate since 1987
 because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
 by the unification process while western germany s economy was in recession
 in the last half of 1991 eastern germany s economy bottomed out after a
 nearly two year freefall and shows signs of recovery particularly in the
 construction transportation and service sectors eastern germany could
 begin a fragile recovery later concentrated in 1992 in construction 
 transportation and services the two regions remain vastly different 
 however despite eastern germany s progress western germany has an advanced
 market economy and is a world leader in exports it has a highly urbanized
 and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant
 leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits western germany is
 relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral 
 western germany s world class companies manufacture technologically advanced
 goods the region s economy is mature services and manufacturing account
 for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and
 semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports in recent
 years manufacturing has accounted for about 31 of gdp with other sectors
 contributing lesser amounts gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
 about 21 of gdp in 1991 gdp in the western region was an estimated
 19 200 per capita in contrast eastern germany s economy is shedding the
 obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the communist
 era eastern germany s share of all german gdp is only about 7 and eastern
 productivity is just 30 that of the west the privatization agency for
 eastern germany the treuhand is rapidly selling many of the 11 500 firms
 under its control the pace of private investment is starting to pick up 
 but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain 
 eastern germany has one of the world s largest reserves of low grade lignite
 coal but little else in the way of mineral resources the quality of
 statistics from eastern germany is improving yet many gaps remain the
 federal government began producing all german data for select economic
 statistics at the start of 1992 the most challenging economic problem is
 promoting eastern germany s economic reconstruction specifically finding
 the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will
 spur investment in eastern germany without destabilizing western germany s
 economy or damaging relations with west european partners the biggest
 danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
 fuel inflation and prompt the german central bank the bundesbank to keep a
 tight monetary policy to choke off a wage price spiral meanwhile the frg
 has been providing billions of dollars to help the former soviet republics
 and the reformist economies of eastern europe

 ghana economy

overview 
 supported by substantial international assistance ghana has been
 implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983 including
 moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls heavily
 dependent on cocoa gold and timber exports economic growth so far has not
 spread substantially to other areas of the economy the costs of sending
 peacekeeping forces to liberia and preparing for the transition to a
 democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
 undercutting structural adjustment reforms ghana opened a stock exchange in
 1990 much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable
 weather following a severe drought the previous year that led to plentiful
 harvests in ghana s agriculturally based economy

 greece economy

overview 
 greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
 system overlaid in 1981 89 by a socialist government that enlarged the
 public sector from 55 of gdp in 1981 to about 70 when prime minister
 mitsotakis took office tourism continues as a major industry and
 agriculture although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented 
 small farms is self sufficient except for meat dairy products and animal
 feedstuffs the mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
 problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations which
 had neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning current account
 deficit and accelerating inflation in early 1991 the government secured a
 2 5 billion assistance package from the ec under the strictest terms yet
 imposed on a member country as the ec finally ran out of patience with
 greece s failure to put its financial affairs in order over the next three
 years athens must bring inflation down to 7 cut the current account
 deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of gdp slash
 public sector employment by 10 curb public sector pay raises and broaden

 greenland economy

overview 
 over the past 25 years the economy has changed from one based on
 subsistence whaling hunting and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade 
 fishing is still the most important industry accounting for over 75 of
 exports and about 25 of the population s income maintenance of a social
 welfare system similar to denmark s has given the public sector a dominant
 role in the economy in 1990 the economy became critically dependent on
 shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy now about 500 million from the
 danish government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
 production stopped as of 1992 the government also has taken control of the
 health sector from denmark the new home rule government installed in march
 1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
 open it wider to competitive forces

 a key industry with most tourists from the us in addition an increasingly

 sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops such as bananas
 which now supply about 50 of export earnings eggplant and flowers 
 other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption 
 although guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food which comes mainly
 from france light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production

 guinea bissau economy

overview 
 guinea bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world with a per
 capita gdp below 200 agriculture and fishing are the main economic
 activities cashew nuts peanuts and palm kernels are the primary exports 
 exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because of a
 weak infrastructure and the high cost of development the government s
 four year plan 1988 91 has targeted agricultural development as the top
 priority

 guyana economy

overview 
 guyana is one of the world s poorest countries with a per capita income less
 than one fifth the south american average after growing on average at less
 than 1 a year in 1986 87 gdp dropped by 5 a year in 1988 90 the decline
 resulted from bad weather labor trouble in the canefields and flooding and
 equipment problems in the bauxite industry consumer prices rose about 100 
 in 1989 and 75 in 1990 and the current account deficit widened
 substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell moreover electric power is
 in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
 output the government in association with international financial
 agencies seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds the
 government s stabilization program aimed at establishing realistic
 exchange rates reasonable price stability and a resumption of growth 
 requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
 by consumers during a long incubation period in 1991 buoyed by a recovery
 in mining and agriculture the economy posted 6 growth according to
 official figures a large volume of illegal and quasi legal economic
 activity is not captured in estimates of the country s total output

overview 
 about 75 of the population live in abject poverty agriculture is mainly
 small scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three fourths of the work
 force the majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
 drinking water adequate medical care or sufficient food few social
 assistance programs exist and the lack of employment opportunities remains
 one of the most critical problems facing the economy along with soil
 erosion and political instability trade sanctions applied by the
 organization of american states in response to the september 1991 coup
 against president aristide have further damaged the economy

overview 
 honduras is one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere

 than 25 of gdp employs 62 of the labor force and produces two thirds of
 exports productivity remains low industry still in its early stages 
 employs nearly 9 of the labor force accounts for 15 of gdp and generates
 20 of exports the service sectors including public administration 
 account for 50 of gdp and employ nearly 20 of the labor force basic
 problems facing the economy include rapid population growth high
 unemployment sharply increased inflation a lack of basic services a large

 hungary economy

overview 
 hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
 market economy agriculture is an important sector providing sizable export
 earnings and meeting domestic food needs industry accounts for about 40 of
 gdp and 30 of employment hungary claims that less than 20 of foreign
 trade is now with former cema countries while about 70 is with oecd
 members hungary s economic reform programs during the communist era gave it
 a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment 
 in 1990 hungary received half of all foreign investment in eastern europe
 and in 1991 received the largest single share the growing private sector
 accounts for one quarter to one third of national output according to
 unofficial estimates privatization of state enterprises is progressing 
 although excessive redtape bureaucratic oversight and uncertainties about
 pricing have slowed the process escalating unemployment and high rates of
 inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform 
 while hungary s heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
 introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993

 iceland economy

overview 
 iceland s prosperous scandinavian type economy is basically capitalistic 
 but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and comparatively
 even distribution of income the economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
 industry which provides nearly 75 of export earnings in the absence of
 other natural resources iceland s economy is vulnerable to changing world
 fish prices the economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
 in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
 tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
 plant the conservative government s economic priorities include reducing
 the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising
 agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the
 krona to the ec s european currency unit in 1993 the fishing industries 
 notably the shrimp industry are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
 mergers inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20 in 1989 to about
 7 5 in 1991 and possibly 3 in 1992 while unemployment is expected to
 increase to 2 5 gdp is expected to contract by nearly 4 in 1992

 india economy

overview 
 india s economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts 
 modern agriculture old and new branches of industry and a multitude of
 support services it presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
 the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
 socialist mold growth of 4 5 annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
 of population growth on unemployment social tranquility and the
 environment agricultural output has continued to expand reflecting the
 greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
 to make india self sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
 exporter however tens of millions of villagers particularly in the south 
 have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty and
 great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life industry
 has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls the growth rate of
 the service sector has also been strong india however has been challenged
 more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves higher inflation and
 a large debt service burden

 indonesia economy

overview 
 indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
 planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise 
 indonesia has extensive natural wealth yet with a large and rapidly
 increasing population it remains a poor country gdp growth in 1985 91
 averaged about 6 quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash
 underemployment and absorb the 2 3 million workers annually entering the
 labor force agriculture including forestry and fishing is an important
 sector accounting for 23 of gdp and over 50 of the labor force the
 staple crop is rice once the world s largest rice importer indonesia is
 now nearly self sufficient plantation crops rubber and palm oil and
 textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
 generation industrial output now accounts for 30 of gdp and is based on a
 supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas 
 timber metals and coal of these the oil sector dominates the external
 economy generating more than 20 of the government s revenues and 40 of
 export earnings in 1989 however the economy s growth is highly dependent
 on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports japan is indonesia s most
 important customer and supplier of aid in 1991 rapid growth in the money
 supply prompted jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy forcing the
 private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing real
 interest rates remained above 10 off shore commercial debt grew and real

 iran economy

overview 
 iran s economy is a mixture of central planning state ownership of oil and
 other large enterprises village agriculture and small scale private
 trading and service ventures after a decade of economic decline iran s gnp
 grew roughly 4 in fy90 and 10 in fy91 an oil windfall in 1990 combined
 with a substantial increase in imports contributed to iran s recent economic
 growth iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
 reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated
 substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
 economy nevertheless lower oil revenues in 1991 oil accounts for more
 than 90 of export revenues and provides roughly 65 of the financing for
 the five year economic development plan and dramatic increases in external
 debt are threatening development plans and could prompt iran to cut imports 
 thus limiting economic growth in the medium term

 iraq economy

overview 
 the ba thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
 industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small scale
 industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise the
 economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has provided about 95 
 of foreign exchange earnings in the 1980s financial problems caused by
 massive expenditures in the eight year war with iran and damage to oil
 export facilities by iran led the government to implement austerity
 measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments 
 after the end of hostilities in 1988 oil exports gradually increased with
 the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities 
 agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization 
 and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
 programs the industrial sector although accorded high priority by the
 government also was under financial constraints iraq s seizure of kuwait
 in august 1990 subsequent international economic embargoes and military
 actions by an international coalition beginning in january 1991 drastically
 changed the economic picture oil exports were cut to near zero and
 industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged throughout
 1991 the un s economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
 increase prices for most goods the government s policy to allocate goods to
 key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages

 israel economy

overview 
 israel has a market economy with substantial government participation it
 depends on imports of crude oil grains raw materials and military
 equipment despite limited natural resources israel has intensively
 developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years 
 industry employs about 20 of israeli workers agriculture 5 and services
 most of the rest diamonds high technology equipment and agricultural
 products fruits and vegetables are leading exports israel usually posts
 balance of payments deficits which are covered by large transfer payments
 from abroad and by foreign loans roughly half of the government s 17
 billion external debt is owed to the united states which is its major
 source of economic and military aid to earn needed foreign exchange israel
 has been targeting high technology niches in international markets such as
 medical scanning equipment iraq s invasion of kuwait in august 1990 dealt a
 blow to israel s economy higher world oil prices added an estimated 300
 million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
 18 regional tension and the continuing palestinian uprising intifadah 
 have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism a key foreign exchange earner
 to the lowest level since the 1973 arab israeli war the influx of jewish
 immigrants from the former ussr which topped 330 000 during the period

 italy economy

overview 
 since world war ii the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
 into a ranking industrial economy with approximately the same total and per
 capita output as france and the uk the country is still divided into a
 developed industrial north dominated by small private companies and an
 undeveloped agricultural south dominated by large public enterprises 
 services account for 48 of gdp industry about 35 agriculture 4 and
 public administration 13 most raw materials needed by industry and over
 75 of energy requirements must be imported after growing at an annual
 average rate of 3 during the period 1983 90 growth slowed to about 1 in
 1991 for the 1990s italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
 communications system curbing pollution in major industrial centers and
 adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
 integration of the european community

 ivory coast economy

overview 
 ivory coast is among the world s largest producers and exporters of coffee 
 cocoa beans and palm kernel oil consequently the economy is highly
 sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
 to weather conditions despite attempts by the government to diversify the
 economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries 
 the agricultural sector accounts for over one third of gdp and about 80 of
 export earnings and employs about 85 of the labor force a collapse of
 world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession 
 from which the country had not recovered by 1990 continuing poor prices for
 commodity exports an overvalued exchange rate a bloated public sector wage
 bill and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in 1991

 jamaica economy

overview 
 the economy is based on sugar bauxite and tourism in 1985 it suffered a
 setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
 industry a major source of hard currency earnings since 1986 an economic
 recovery has been under way in 1987 conditions began to improve for the
 bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices the
 recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
 sectors in september 1988 hurricane gilbert inflicted severe damage on
 crops and the electric power system a sharp but temporary setback to the
 economy by october 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
 largely complete and real growth was up about 3 for 1989 in 1991

 japan economy

overview 
 government industry cooperation a strong work ethic and a comparatively
 small defense allocation have helped japan advance with extraordinary
 rapidity notably in high technology fields industry the most important
 sector of the economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
 fuels self sufficent in rice japan must import 50 of its requirements for
 other grain and fodder crops japan maintains one of the world s largest
 fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch overall
 economic growth has been spectacular a 10 average in the 1960s a 5 
 average in the 1970s and 1980s a major contributor to overall growth of
 4 5 in 1991 was net exports which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
 domestic demand inflation remains low at 3 3 and is easing due to lower
 oil prices and a stronger yen japan continues to run a huge trade surplus 
 80 billion in 1991 which supports extensive investment in foreign assets 
 the increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
 population are two major long run problems

 jordan economy

overview 
 jordan benefited from increased arab aid during the oil boom of the late
 1970s and early 1980s when its annual gnp growth averaged more than 10 in
 the remainder of the 1980s however reductions in both arab aid and worker
 remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2 per year 
 imports mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food have been
 outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and
 borrowing in mid 1989 the jordanian government began debt rescheduling
 negotiations and agreed to implement an imf program designed to gradually
 reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms the
 persian gulf crisis that began in august 1990 however aggravated jordan s
 already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the imf
 program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations aid
 from gulf arab states and worker remittances have plunged and refugees have
 flooded the country straining government resources economic recovery is
 unlikely without substantial foreign aid debt relief and economic reform

 kazakhstan economy

overview 
 the second largest in area of the 15 former soviet republics kazakhstan has
 vast oil coal and agricultural resources kazakhstan is highly dependent
 on trade with russia exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
 and industrial goods kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
 problems backward technology and little experience in foreign markets the
 government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
 russia s program the ongoing transitional period marked by sharp
 inflation in wages and prices lower output lost jobs and disruption of
 time honored channels of supply has brought considerable social unrest 
 kazakhstan lacks the funds technology and managerial skills for a quick
 recovery of output us firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
 face formidable obstacles for example oil can now reach western markets
 only through pipelines that run across independent and sometimes
 unfriendly former soviet republics finally the end of monolithic
 communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open the 6 million
 russians in the republic formerly the favored class now face the hostility
 of a society dominated by muslims ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
 formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive technologically
 advancing society

 kiribati economy

overview 
 the country has few national resources commercially viable phosphate
 deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979 copra and fish
 now represent the bulk of production and exports the economy has fluctuated
 widely in recent years real gdp declined about 8 in 1987 as the fish
 catch fell sharply to only one fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
 was hampered by repeated rains output rebounded strongly in 1988 with real
 gdp growing by 17 the upturn in economic growth came from an increase in
 copra production and a good fish catch following the strong surge in output
 in 1988 gnp increased 1 in both 1989 and 1990

 korea north economy

overview 
 more than 90 of this command economy is socialized agricultural land is
 collectivized and state owned industry produces 95 of manufactured goods 
 state control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a communist
 country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
 strict rule of kim il song and his son kim chong il economic growth during
 the period 1984 89 averaged 2 3 but output declined by 2 4 annually
 during 1990 91 largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
 the ussr abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
 industrial development output of the extractive industries includes coal 
 iron ore magnesite graphite copper zinc lead and precious metals 
 manufacturing is centered on heavy industry with light industry lagging far
 behind despite the use of improved seed varieties expansion of irrigation 
 and the heavy use of fertilizers north korea has not yet become
 self sufficient in food production four consecutive years of poor harvests 
 coupled with distribution problems have led to chronic food shortages 
 north korea remains far behind south korea in economic development and
 living standards

overview 
 the driving force behind the economy s dynamic growth has been the planned
 development of an export oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
 society real gnp has increased more than 10 annually over the past six
 years this growth has led to an overheated situation characterized by a
 tight labor market strong inflationary pressures and a rapidly rising
 current account deficit policymakers have stated they will focus attention
 on slowing inflation in any event the economy will remain the envy of the

 kuwait economy

overview 
 up to the invasion by iraq in august 1990 the oil sector had dominated the
 economy kuwait has the third largest oil reserves in the world after saudi
 arabia and iraq earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90 of both
 export and government revenues and contributed about 40 to gdp most of the
 nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oil derived government
 revenues iraq s destruction of kuwait s oil industry during the gulf war
 has devastated the economy iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80 of
 kuwait s 950 operating oil wells as well as sabotaged key surface
 facilities firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and
 blowouts under control by november 1991 by yearend production had been
 brought back to 400 000 barrels per day it could take two to three years to
 restore kuwait s oil production to its prewar level of about 2 0 million
 barrels per day meanwhile population had been greatly reduced because of
 the war from 2 1 million to 1 4 million

 union is oriented toward agriculture producing mainly livestock such as
 goats and sheep as well as cotton grain and tobacco industry

 livestock feeding equipment washing machines furniture cement paper and
 bricks mineral extraction is small the most important minerals being rare
 earth metals and gold kyrgyzstan is a net importer of most types of food
 and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity by early 1991 the kirghiz
 leadership had accelerated reform primarily by privatizing business and
 granting life long tenure to farmers in 1991 overall industrial and

 latvia economy

overview 
 latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned economy
 inherited from the former ussr into a market economy prices have been
 freed and privatization of shops and farms has begun latvia lacks natural
 resources aside from its arable land and small forests its most valuable
 economic asset is its work force which is better educated and disciplined
 than in most of the former soviet republics industrial production is highly
 diversified with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
 electronics one conspicuous vulnerability latvia produces only 10 of its
 electric power needs latvia in the near term must retain key commercial
 ties to russia belarus and ukraine while moving in the long run toward
 joint ventures technological support and trade ties to the west because
 of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms latvians enjoy a diet that
 is higher in meat vegetables and dairy products and lower in grain and
 potatoes than diets in the 12 non baltic republics of the ussr good
 relations with russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic russians

 lebanon government

note 
 between early 1975 and late 1976 lebanon was torn by civil war between its
 christians then aided by syrian troops and its muslims and their
 palestinian allies the cease fire established in october 1976 between the
 domestic political groups generally held for about six years despite
 occasional fighting syrian troops constituted as the arab deterrent force
 by the arab league have remained in lebanon syria s move toward supporting
 the lebanese muslims and the palestinians and israel s growing support for
 lebanese christians brought the two sides into rough equilibrium but no
 progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms the
 original cause of the war continuing israeli concern about the palestinian
 presence in lebanon led to the israeli invasion of lebanon in june 1982 
 israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and
 mounted a summer long siege of beirut which resulted in the evacuation of
 the plo from beirut in september under the supervision of a multinational
 force mnf made up of us french and italian troops within days of the
 departure of the mnf lebanon s newly elected president bashir gemayel was
 assassinated his elder brother amin was elected to succeed him in the
 immediate wake of bashir s death however christian militiamen massacred
 hundreds of palestinian refugees in two beirut camps this prompted the
 return of the mnf to ease the security burden on lebanon s weak army and
 security forces in late march 1984 the last mnf units withdrew in 1988 
 president gemayel completed his term of office because parliamentarians
 failed to elect a presidential successor gemayel appointed then lebanese
 armed forces laf commander gen michel awn acting president lebanese
 parliamentarians met in ta if saudi arabia in late 1989 and concluded a
 national reconciliation pact that codified a new power sharing formula 
 specifying reduced powers for the christian president and giving muslims
 more authority rene muawad was subsequently elected president on 4 november
 1989 ending a 13 month period during which lebanon had no president and
 rival muslim and christian governments muawad was assassinated 17 days
 later on 22 november on 24 november ilyas harawi was elected to succeed
 muawad in october 1990 the civil war was apparently brought to a
 conclusion when syrian and lebanese forces ousted renegade christian general
 awn from his stronghold in east beirut awn had defied the legitimate
 government and established a separate ministate within east beirut after
 being appointed acting prime minister by outgoing president gemayel in 1988 
 awn and his supporters feared ta if would diminish christian power in
 lebanon and increase the influence of syria awn was granted amnesty and
 allowed to travel in france in august 199l since the removal of awn the
 lebanese government has made substantial progress in strengthening the
 central government rebuilding government institutions and extending its
 authority throughout the nation the laf has deployed from beirut north
 along the coast road to tripoli southeast into the shuf mountains and
 south to sidon and tyre many militiamen from christian and muslim groups
 have evacuated beirut for their strongholds in the north south and east of
 the country some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned
 over to the government or sold outside the country which has begun a plan
 to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security
 forces lebanon and syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
 may 1991 lebanon continues to be partially occupied by syrian troops which
 are deployed in beirut its southern suburbs the bekaa valley and northern
 lebanon iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in
 the bekaa valley to support lebanese islamic fundamentalist groups israel
 withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985 although it still
 retains troops in a 10 km deep security zone north of its border with
 lebanon israel arms and trains the army of south lebanon asl which also
 occupies the security zone and is israel s first line of defense against
 attacks on its northern border the following description is based on the
 present constitutional and customary practices of the lebanese system 

 lebanon economy

overview 
 since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged lebanon s economic
 infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended lebanon s
 position as a middle eastern entrepot and banking hub following october
 1990 however a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
 restoring control in beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port
 and government facilities the battered economy has also been propped up by
 a financially sound banking system and resilient small and medium scale
 manufacturers family remittances banking transactions manufactured and
 farm exports the narcotics trade and international emergency aid are main
 sources of foreign exchange in the relatively settled year of 1991 
 industrial production agricultural output and exports showed substantial
 gains the further rebuilding of the war ravaged country could provide a
 major stimulus to the economy in 1992 provided that the political and
 military situation remains reasonably calm

 liberia economy

overview 
 civil war during 1990 destroyed much of liberia s economy especially the
 infrastructure in and around monrovia expatriate businessmen fled the
 country taking capital and expertise with them many will not return 
 richly endowed with water mineral resources forests and a climate
 favorable to agriculture liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
 products while local manufacturing mainly foreign owned had been small in
 scope political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
 and repatriation of some 750 000 liberian refugees who fled to neighboring
 countries in 1991 the political impasse between the interim government and
 the rebel leader charles taylor prevented restoration of normal economic

 libya economy

overview 
 the socialist oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
 sector which contributes practically all export earnings and about
 one third of gdp since 1980 however the sharp drop in oil prices and the
 resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic
 development in 1988 per capita gdp was the highest in africa at 5 410 but
 gdp growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in
 the world oil market import restrictions and inefficient resource
 allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although
 the reopening of the libyan tunisian border in april 1988 and the
 libyan egyptian border in december 1989 have somewhat eased shortages 
 austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the
 government s ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure
 development projects windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in
 late 1990 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current
 account surplus for the first time in five years the nonoil manufacturing
 and construction sectors which account for about 22 of gdp have expanded
 from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals 
 iron steel and aluminum although agriculture accounts for about 5 of
 gdp it employs about 20 of the labor force climatic conditions and poor
 soils severely limit farm output and libya imports about 75 of its food

 lithuania economy

overview 
 lithuania is striving to become a small independent largely privatized
 economy rather than a segment of a huge centrally planned economy although
 substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old
 ussr lithuania historically lagged behind latvia and estonia in economic
 development it is ahead of its baltic neighbors however in implementing
 market reform the country has no important natural resources aside from its
 arable land and strategic location industry depends entirely on imported
 materials that have come from the republics of the former ussr lithuania
 benefits from its ice free port at klaipeda on the baltic sea and its rail
 and highway hub at vilnius which provides land communication between
 eastern europe and russia latvia estonia and belarus industry produces a
 small assortment of high quality products ranging from complex machine
 tools to sophisticated consumer electronics thanks to nuclear power 
 lithuania is presently self sufficient in electricity exporting its surplus
 to latvia and belarus the nuclear facilities inherited from the ussr 
 however have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety
 standards agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former soviet
 union lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat second
 place for eggs and potatoes and fourth place for milk and dairy products 
 grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries as to
 economic reforms lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at
 least 60 of state owned property industry agriculture and housing 
 having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system other
 government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting
 the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from
 eastern markets to the more competitive western markets for the moment 
 lithuania will remain highly dependent on russia for energy raw materials 
 grains and markets for its products

 macedonia economy

overview 
 macedonia although the poorest among the six republics of a disintegrated
 yugoslav federation can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
 agricultural and coal resources as a breakaway republic however it will
 move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are
 reforged or enlarged with its neighbors serbia albania greece and
 bulgaria the economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas
 and its modern machinery and parts continued political turmoil both
 internally and in the region as a whole prevents any swift readjustments of
 trade patterns and economic rules of the game inflation in early 1992 was
 out of control the result of fracturing trade links the decline in
 economic activity and general uncertainties about the future status of the
 country prices rose 38 in march 1992 alone macedonia s geographical
 isolation technological backwardness and political instability place it
 far down the list of countries of interest to western investors recognition
 of macedonia by the ec and an internal commitment to economic reform would
 help to encourage foreign investment over the long run

 madagascar economy

overview 
 madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world agriculture 
 including fishing and forestry is the mainstay of the economy accounting
 for over 40 of gdp employing about 80 of the labor force and
 contributing to more than 70 of total export earnings industry is largely
 confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
 manufacturing in 1990 it accounted for only 16 of gdp and employed almost
 5 of the labor force in 1986 the government introduced a five year
 development plan that stressed self sufficiency in food mainly rice by
 1990 increased production for exports and reduced energy imports after
 mid 1991 however output dropped sharply because of protracted
 antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform

 martinique economy

overview 
 the economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and light industry 
 agriculture accounts for about 12 of gdp and the small industrial sector
 for 10 sugar production has declined with most of the sugarcane now used
 for the production of rum banana exports are increasing going mostly to
 france the bulk of meat vegetable and grain requirements must be
 imported contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
 transfers of aid from france tourism has become more important than
 agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange the majority of the
 work force is employed in the service sector and in administration in 1986
 per capita gdp was relatively high at 6 000 during 1986 the unemployment
 rate was 30 and was particularly severe among younger workers

 mauritania economy

overview 
 a majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
 a livelihood even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
 were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s 
 mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore which account for almost 50 
 of total exports the decline in world demand for this ore however has led
 to cutbacks in production the nation s coastal waters are among the richest
 fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
 this key source of revenue the country s first deepwater port opened near
 nouakchott in 1986 in recent years the droughts the endemic conflict with
 senegal rising energy costs and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
 substantial buildup of foreign debt the government has begun the second
 stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the world bank the
 imf and major donor countries but the reform process suffered a major
 setback following the gulf war of early 1991 because of mauritania s
 support of saddam husayn bilateral aid from its two top donors saudi
 arabia and kuwait was suspended and multilateral aid was reduced

 micronesia federated states of economy

overview 
 economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing the
 islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting except for high grade
 phosphate the potential for a tourist industry exists but the remoteness
 of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development 
 financial assistance from the us is the primary source of revenue with the
 us pledged to spend 1 billion in the islands in the l990s geographical
 isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to

 moldova economy

overview 
 moldova the next to smallest of the former soviet republics in area is the
 most densely inhabited moldova has a little more than 1 of the population 
 labor force capital stock and output of the former soviet union living
 standards have been below average for the european ussr the country enjoys
 a favorable climate and economic development has been primarily based on
 agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and tobacco industry
 accounts for 20 of the labor force whereas agriculture employs more than
 one third moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
 former soviet republics for coal oil gas steel most electronic
 equipment machine tools and major consumer durables such as automobiles 
 its industrial and agricultural products in turn have been exported to the
 other former soviet republics moldova has freed prices on most goods and
 has legalized private ownership of property including agricultural land 
 moldova s economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
 a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
 former soviet republics and romania

 mongolia economy

overview 
 mongolia s severe climate scattered population and wide expanses of
 unproductive land have constrained economic development economic activity
 traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock 
 mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world in
 recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with soviet
 support the mining and processing of coal copper molybdenum tin 
 tungsten and gold account for a large part of industrial production timber
 and fishing are also important sectors in 1991 92 mongolian leadership is
 struggling with severe economic dislocations mainly attributable to the
 economic crumbling of the ussr by far mongolia s leading trade and
 development partner moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991 and the
 dissolution of the ussr at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
 for 1992 industry in 1991 92 has been hit hard by energy shortages mainly
 due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports 
 the government is moving away from the soviet style centrally planned
 economy through privatization and price reform

 morocco economy

overview 
 the economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of the resolution of a
 trade dispute with india over phosphoric acid sales a rebound in textile
 sales to the ec lower prices for food imports a sharp increase in worker
 remittances increased arab donor aid and generous debt rescheduling
 agreements economic performance in 1991 was mixed a record harvest helped
 real gdp advance by 4 2 although nonagricultural output grew by less than
 1 inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
 rapid credit and monetary growth despite recovery of domestic demand 
 import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
 phosphate marketing difficulties in january 1992 morocco reached a new
 12 month standby arrangement for 129 million with the imf in february
 1992 the paris club rescheduled 1 4 billion of morocco s commercial debt 
 this is thought to be morocco s last rescheduling by 1993 the moroccan
 authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
 without additional rescheduling servicing this large debt high
 unemployment and morocco s vulnerability to external economic forces remain

 mozambique economy

overview 
 one of africa s poorest countries mozambique has failed to exploit the
 economic potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and
 transportation resources indeed national output consumption and
 investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
 internal disorders lack of government administrative control and a growing
 foreign debt a sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic
 reform policy has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
 1985 agricultural output nevertheless is at about only 75 of its 1981
 level and grain has to be imported industry operates at only 20 40 of
 capacity the economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat 
 the continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign
 investment and growth was a mere 1 living standards already abysmally
 low dropped by 3 4 in both 1990 and 1991

 nauru economy

overview 
 revenues come from the export of phosphates the reserves of which are
 expected to be exhausted by the year 2000 phosphates have given nauruans
 one of the highest per capita incomes in the third world 10 000 annually 
 few other resources exist so most necessities must be imported including
 fresh water from australia the rehabilitation of mined land and the
 replacement of income from phosphates are serious long term problems 
 substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
 cushion the transition

 nepal economy

overview 
 nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world 
 agriculture is the mainstay of the economy providing a livelihood for over
 90 of the population and accounting for 60 of gdp industrial activity is
 limited mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce jute 
 sugarcane tobacco and grain production of textiles and carpets has
 expanded recently and accounted for 87 of foreign exchange earnings in
 fy89 apart from agricultural land and forests the only other exploitable
 natural resources are mica hydropower and tourism agricultural production
 in the late 1980s grew by about 5 as compared with annual population
 growth of 2 6 forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
 partly because of poor distribution since may 1991 the government has been
 encouraging privatization and foreign investment it has introduced policies
 to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
 to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures economic prospects
 for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base

 expansion of welfare benefits the results have been mixed inflation is
 down from double digit levels but growth has been sluggish and

 the chamorro government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention four
 private banks have been licensed and the government has liberalized foreign
 trade and abolished price controls on most goods over 50 of the
 agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned sandinista economic
 policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis the foundation
 of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities 
 largely coffee and cotton farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 and 4 
 in 1990 and remained about even in 1991 the agricultural sector employs
 44 of the work force and accounts for 15 of gdp and 80 of export
 earnings industry which employs 13 of the work force and contributes
 about 25 to gdp showed a drop of 7 in 1989 fell slightly in 1990 and
 remained flat in 1991 output still is below pre 1979 levels external debt

 niger economy

overview 
 about 90 of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising 
 activities that generate almost half the national income the economy also
 depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits uranium
 production grew rapidly in the mid 1970s but tapered off in the early 1980s
 when world prices declined france is a major customer while germany 
 japan and spain also make regular purchases the depressed demand for
 uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy a severe
 trade imbalance and a mounting external debt

 nigeria economy

overview 
 although nigeria is africa s leading oil producing country it remains poor
 with a 250 per capita gdp in 1991 massive government spending much of it
 to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule ballooned the budget
 deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise the lack of fiscal
 discipline forced the imf to declare nigeria not in compliance with an
 18 month standby facility started in january 1991 lagos has set ambitious
 targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
 companies more attractive investment incentives government efforts to
 reduce nigeria s dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
 growth however have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
 funds and endemic corruption living standards continue to deteriorate from
 the higher level of the early 1980s oil boom

 cash crops are grown for export industry consists primarily of small
 factories to process passion fruit lime oil honey and coconut cream the
 sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of
 revenue the island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of
 population because of migration of niueans to new zealand

 norway economy

overview 
 norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
 and government intervention the government controls key areas such as the
 vital petroleum sector through large scale state enterprises and
 extensively subsidizes agricultural fishing and other sectors norway also
 maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel public sector
 expenditures to slightly more than 50 of the gdp and results in one of the
 highest average tax burdens in the world 54 a small country with a high
 dependence on international trade norway is basically an exporter of raw
 materials and semiprocessed goods with an abundance of small and
 medium sized firms and is ranked among the major shipping nations the
 country is richly endowed with natural resources petroleum hydropower 
 fish forests and minerals and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
 keep its economy afloat although one of the government s main priorities is
 to reduce this dependency this situation is not likely to improve for years
 to come the government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
 diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget 
 forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because
 of public sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
 and demand inflation will remain about 3 while unemployment continues at
 record levels of over 5 because of the weakness of the economy outside the
 oil sector oslo a member of the european free trade area is continuing to
 deregulate and harmonize with ec regulations to prepare for the european
 economic area eea which creates a ec efta market with free movement of
 capital goods services and labor which takes effect in 1993

climate 
 the western pacific is monsoonal a rainy season occurs during the summer
 months when moisture laden winds blow from the ocean over the land and a
 dry season during the winter months when dry winds blow from the asian land
 mass back to the ocean
terrain 
 surface in the northern pacific dominated by a clockwise warm water gyre
 broad circular system of currents and in the southern pacific by a
 counterclockwise cool water gyre sea ice occurs in the bering sea and sea
 of okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from antarctica
 in october the ocean floor in the eastern pacific is dominated by the east
 pacific rise while the western pacific is dissected by deep trenches the
 world s greatest depth is 10 924 meters in the marianas trench

 southeast and east asia from may to december most frequent from july to
 october tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of mexico and strike
 central america and mexico from june to october most common in august and
 september southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from antarctica 
 occasional el nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of peru when the trade
 winds slacken and the warm equatorial countercurrent moves south killing
 the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies consequently 
 the anchovies move to better feeding grounds causing resident marine birds
 to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
note 
 the major choke points are the bering strait panama canal luzon strait 
 and the singapore strait the equator divides the pacific ocean into the
 north pacific ocean and the south pacific ocean ships subject to
 superstructure icing in extreme north from october to may and in extreme
 south from may to october persistent fog in the northern pacific from june
 to december is a hazard to shipping surrounded by a zone of violent
 volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the pacific ring
 of fire

 pacific ocean economy

overview 
 the pacific ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
 particularly to those nations its waters directly touch it provides cheap
 sea transportation between east and west extensive fishing grounds 
 offshore oil and gas fields minerals and sand and gravel for the
 construction industry in 1985 over half 54 of the world s total fish
 catch came from the pacific ocean which is the only ocean where the fish
 catch has increased every year since 1978 exploitation of offshore oil and
 gas reserves is playing an ever increasing role in the energy supplies of
 australia new zealand china us and peru the high cost of recovering
 offshore oil and gas combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
 since 1985 has slowed but not stopped new drillings

 pakistan economy

overview 
 pakistan is a poor third world country faced with the usual problems of
 rapidly increasing population sizable government deficits and heavy
 dependence on foreign aid in addition the economy must support a large
 military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million afghan
 refugees a real economic growth rate averaging 5 6 in recent years has
 enabled the country to cope with these problems almost all agriculture and
 small scale industry is in private hands in 1990 pakistan embarked on a
 sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
 private investment and lower foreign aid dependence the sharif government
 has denationalized several state owned firms and has attracted some foreign
 investment pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
 because of its rapidly expanding population at the current rate of growth 
 population would double in 25 years

 paraguay economy

overview 
 agriculture including forestry accounts for about 25 of gdp employs
 about 45 of the labor force and provides the bulk of exports paraguay has
 no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
 hydropower potential since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
 with the boom period of 1976 81 when real gdp grew at an average annual
 rate of nearly 11 during the period 1982 86 real gdp fell in three of five
 years inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32 and foreign debt rose 
 factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
 completion of the itaipu hydroelectric dam bad weather for crops and weak
 international commodity prices for agricultural exports in 1987 the economy
 experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
 stronger international prices for key agricultural exports the recovery
 continued through 1990 on the strength of bumper crops in 1988 89 in a
 major step to increase its economic activity in the region paraguay in
 march 1991 joined the southern cone common market mercosur which includes
 brazil argentina and uruguay during 1991 the government began to more
 seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
 domestic fiscal problems inflation was cut in third but the foreign trade
 deficit widened to more than 1 billion for the long run the government
 must press forward with general market oriented economic reforms

 peru economy

overview 
 the peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented with a large
 dose of government ownership remaining in mining energy and banking in
 the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita
 output and mounting external debt peru was shut off from imf and world
 bank support in the mid 1980s because of its huge debt arrears an austerity
 program implemented shortly after the fujimori government took office in
 july 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
 activity but the slide halted late in the year and output rose 2 4 in
 1991 after a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
 government price subsidies monthly price increases eased to the
 single digit level and by december 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
 mid 1987 lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
 in september 1991 and although it faces 14 billion in arrears on its
 external debt is working to pay some 1 8 billion of these to the imf and
 world bank by 1993

 poland economy

overview 
 poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a soviet style economy 
 with state ownership and control of productive assets to a market economy 
 on january 1 1990 the new solidarity led government implemented shock
 therapy by slashing subsidies decontrolling prices tightening the money
 supply stabilizing the foreign exchange rate lowering import barriers and
 restraining state sector wages as a result consumer goods shortages and
 lines disappeared and inflation fell from 640 in 1989 to 60 in 1991 
 western governments which hold two thirds of poland s 48 billion external
 debt pledged in 1991 to forgive half of poland s official debt by 1994 and
 the private sector grew accounting for 22 of industrial production and 40 
 of nonagricultural output by 1991 production fell in state enterprises 
 however and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
 in 1989 to 11 4 in december 1991 poland fell out of compliance with its
 imf program by mid 1991 and talks with commercial creditors stalled the
 increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
 discontent and a change in government in january 1991 and again in december 
 the new government has promised selective industrial intervention some
 relaxation in monetary policy and an improved social safety net but will
 be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit

 portugal economy

overview 
 although portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the ec in 1986
 at least 4 each year through 1990 it remains one of the poorest
 members to prepare for the european single market the government is
 restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
 privatization program the global slowdown and tight monetary policies to
 counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991 but it is likely to recover

 industry to relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to one third
 of the labor force the gap in reunion between the well off and the poor is
 extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions the white and
 indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
 population often approaching european standards whereas indigenous groups
 suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
 african continent the outbreak of severe rioting in february 1991
 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions the economic
 well being of reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from

 romania economy

overview 
 industry which accounts for about one third of the labor force and
 generates over half the gdp suffers from an aging capital plant and
 persistent shortages of energy the year 1991 witnessed about a 17 drop in
 industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
 unrest in recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
 flooding mismanagement shortages of inputs and disarray caused by the
 dismantling of cooperatives a shortage of fuel and equipment in 1991
 contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption and
 a poor distribution system the new government is loosening the tight
 central controls of ceausescu s command economy it has instituted moderate
 land reforms with more than one half of cropland now in private hands and
 it has liberalized private agricultural output also the new regime is
 permitting the establishment of private enterprises largely in services 
 handicrafts and small scale industry a law providing for the privatization
 of large state firms has been passed most of the large state firms have
 been converted into joint stock companies but the selling of shares and
 assets to private owners has been delayed while the government has halted
 the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
 export markets supplies remain scarce in some areas furthermore real
 wages in romania fell about 20 in 1991 contributing to the unrest which
 forced the resignation of roman in september the new government continues
 to impose price ceilings on key consumer items

 russia economy

overview 
 russia one of the world s largest economies possesses a wealth of natural
 resources and a diverse industrial base within the now dismantled ussr it
 had produced 60 of total output with 55 of the total labor force and 60 
 of the total capital stock russia depends on its world class deposits of
 oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
 earnings self sufficient in coal and iron ore it has a crude steel
 production capacity of about 95 million tons second only to japan russia s
 machine building sector 60 of the old ussr s lags behind world
 standards of efficiency and quality of product other major industrial
 sectors chemicals construction materials light industry and food
 processing also suffer from quality problems obsolescent capital
 equipment and pollution consumer goods have had lower priority and the
 product mix has not mirrored household preferences furthermore the
 transition to a more market oriented economy has disrupted channels of
 supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods
 and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption 
 russia inherited 70 of the former ussr s defense production facilities and
 is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
 plants to civilian production russia produces almost half of the old ussr s
 farm products but most warm climate crops must be imported under the old
 ussr production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
 in a single firm or a single republic today producing units often have
 lost their major customers and their major sources of supply and the market
 institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
 situations are only slowly emerging rank and file russians will continue to
 suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to
 realize its great economic potential the comprehensive economic reform
 program enacted in january 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles
 before it will lead to sustained economic growth

 rwanda economy

overview 
 almost 50 of gdp comes from the agricultural sector coffee and tea make up
 80 90 of total exports the amount of fertile land is limited however and
 deforestation and soil erosion have created problems the industrial sector
 in rwanda is small contributing only 17 to gdp manufacturing focuses
 mainly on the processing of agricultural products the rwandan economy
 remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid weak international
 prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita gdp to
 decline a structural adjustment program with the world bank began in
 october 1990 an outbreak of insurgency also in october has dampened any
 prospects for economic improvement

 saint pierre and miquelon economy

overview 
 the inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
 servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of newfoundland the
 economy has been declining however because the number of ships stopping at
 saint pierre has dropped steadily over the years in march 1989 an
 agreement between france and canada set fish quotas for saint pierre s
 trawlers fishing in canadian and canadian claimed waters for three years 
 the agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
 exports to a halt the islands are heavily subsidized by france imports
 come primarily from canada and france

 sao tome and principe economy

overview 
 the economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
 independence nearly 15 years ago since then however cocoa production has
 gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement so that by 1987
 output had fallen to less than 50 of its former levels as a result a
 shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance of payments
 problem production of less important crops such as coffee copra and palm
 kernels has also declined the value of imports generally exceeds that of
 exports by a ratio of 4 1 the emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
 of other food crops has meant that sao tome has to import 90 of food needs 
 it also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods over the years 
 sao tome has been unable to service its external debt which amounts to
 roughly 80 of export earnings considerable potential exists for
 development of a tourist industry and the government has taken steps to
 expand facilities in recent years the government also implemented a
 five year plan covering 1986 90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
 external debt service payments in cooperation with the international
 development association and western lenders

 serbia and montenegro economy

overview 
 the swift collapse of the yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
 ethnic warfare the destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup
 of important interrepublic trade flows the situation in serbia and
 montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
 strife this new state faces major economic problems first like the other
 former yugoslav republics serbia and montenegro depended on their sister
 republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and
 manufactures wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of
 technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did
 the communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
 number of giant plants the breakup of many of the trade links the sharp
 drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the
 destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
 economic difficulties of the republics one singular factor in the economic
 situation of serbia and montenegro is the continuation in office of a
 communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
 mastery not economic reform a further complication is the major economic
 sanctions by the leading industrial nations

 growing season produces fruit grapes and cereals in this area livestock
 production sheep and cattle and dairy farming prosper kosovo province
 produces fruits vegetables tobacco and a small amount of cereals the
 mountainous pastures of kosovo and montenegro support sheep and goat

 sierra leone economy

overview 
 the economic and social infrastructure is not well developed subsistence
 agriculture dominates the economy generating about one third of gdp and
 employing about two thirds of the working population manufacturing which
 accounts for roughly 10 of gdp consists mainly of the processing of raw
 materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market diamond mining
 provides an important source of hard currency the economy suffers from high
 unemployment rising inflation large trade deficits and a growing
 dependency on foreign assistance the government in 1990 was attempting to
 get the budget deficit under control and in general to bring economic
 policy in line with the recommendations of the imf and the world bank since
 march 1991 however military incursions by liberian rebels in southern and
 eastern sierra leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
 efforts to institute economic reforms

 slovenia economy

overview 
 slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old yugoslav republics with
 a per capita income more than twice the yugoslav average indeed not far
 below the levels in neighboring austria and italy because of its strong
 ties to western europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
 fighting in yugoslavia slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
 former yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
 years the political and economic disintegration of yugoslavia however has
 led to severe short term dislocations in production employment and trade
 ties for example overall industrial production fell 10 in 1991 
 particularly hard hit were the iron and steel machine building chemical 
 and textile industries meanwhile fighting has continued in other republics
 leading to further destruction of long established trade channels and to an
 influx of tens of thousands of croatian refugees as in other former
 communist areas in eastern europe economic reform has often sputtered not
 only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
 the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
 rank and file people in the transition to a more market oriented system the
 key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
 yet begun bright spots for encouraging western investors are slovenia s
 comparatively well educated work force its developed infrastructure and
 its western business attitudes slovenia in absolute terms is a small
 economy and a little western investment would go a long way

 south africa economy

overview 
 many of the white one seventh of the south african population enjoy incomes 
 material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of
 western europe in contrast most of the remaining population suffers from
 the poverty patterns of the third world including unemployment lack of job
 skills and barriers to movement into higher paying fields inputs and
 outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and
 the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
 constraints on dealings with south africa the main strength of the economy
 lies in its rich mineral resources which provide two thirds of exports 
 average growth of less than 2 in output in recent years falls far short of
 the 5 to 6 level needed to absorb some 300 000 new entrants to the labor
 force annually economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
 the changing relations among the various ethnic groups

 spain economy

overview 
 spain has done well since joining the ec in 1986 in accordance with its
 accession treaty spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
 markets foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4 
 per year beginning in 1989 madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
 fight inflation around 7 in 1989 and 1990 as a result growth slowed to
 2 5 in 1991 spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation still
 hovering at 6 government officials also are worried about 16 
 unemployment although many people listed as unemployed work in the
 underground economy spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
 due to the ongoing integration of the european market are likely to lead to
 more displaced workers

 sudan economy

overview 
 sudan is buffeted by civil war chronic political instability adverse
 weather high inflation and counterproductive economic policies the
 economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70 
 of new investment the private sector s main areas of activity are
 agriculture and trading with most private industrial investment predating
 1980 the economy s base is agriculture which employs 80 of the work
 force industry mainly processes agricultural items sluggish economic
 performance over the past decade attributable largely to declining annual
 rainfall has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption a high
 foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties in 1990 the
 international monetary fund took the unusual step of declaring sudan
 noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the fund despite
 subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the imf and the
 world bank the economy remained stagnant in fy91 as entrepreneurs lack the
 incentive to take economic risks

 suriname economy

overview 
 the economy is dominated by the bauxite industry which accounts for about
 70 of export earnings and 40 of tax revenues the economy has been in
 trouble since the dutch ended development aid in 1982 a drop in world
 bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
 was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
 crippled the important bauxite sector although the insurgency has since
 ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered a military coup in december 1990
 reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
 economic reform high inflation high unemployment widespread black market
 activity and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy

 sweden economy

overview 
 aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during world war i through
 world war ii sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
 mixed system of high tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits it has
 essentially full employment a modern distribution system excellent
 internal and external communications and a skilled labor force timber 
 hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
 heavily oriented toward foreign trade privately owned firms account for
 about 90 of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for
 50 of output and exports in the last few years however this
 extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation growing
 absenteeism and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets 
 the new center right government facing a sagging economic situation which
 is unlikely to improve until 1993 is pushing full steam ahead with economic
 reform proposals to end sweden s recession and to prepare for possible ec
 membership in 1995 the free market oriented reforms are designed to spur
 growth maintain price stability lower unemployment create a more
 efficient welfare state and further adapt to ec standards the measures
 include cutting taxes particularly the value added tax vat and levies on
 new and small business privatization liberalizing foreign ownership
 restrictions and opening the welfare system to competition and private
 alternatives which the government will still finance growth is expected to
 remain flat in 1992 but increase slightly in 1993 while inflation should
 remain around 3 for the next few years on the down side unemployment may
 climb to slightly over 4 in 1993 and the budget deficit will reach nearly
 9 billion in 1992

 switzerland economy

overview 
 switzerland s economic success is matched in few other nations per capita
 output general living standards education and science health care and
 diet are unsurpassed in europe economic stability helps promote the
 important banking and tourist sectors since world war ii switzerland s
 economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
 patterns in europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the 1990s 
 particularly to the further economic integration of western europe and the
 amazingly rapid changes in east european political and economic prospects 
 after 8 years of growth the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991
 because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
 weak international economy in the second half of 1992 however switzerland
 is expected to resume growth despite inflation and unemployment problems 
 gdp growth for 1992 may be just under 1 inflation should drop from 5 9 to
 3 5 and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
 15 to 5 billion due to increased exports to germany unemployment 
 however is forecast to rise to 1 6 in 1992 up from 1 3 in 1991 and 0 5 
 in 1990

 syria economy

overview 
 syria s state dominated ba thist economy has benefited from the gulf war 
 increased oil production good weather and economic deregulation economic
 growth averaged nearly 12 annually in 1990 91 buoyed by increased oil
 production and improved agricultural performance the gulf war of early 1991
 provided syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from arab 
 european and japanese donors these inflows more than offset damascus s
 war related costs and will help syria cover some of its debt arrears 
 restore suspended credit lines and initiate selected military and civilian
 purchases for the long run syria s economy is still saddled with a large
 number of poorly performing public sector firms investment levels remain
 low and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor a major long term
 concern is the additional drain of upstream euphrates water by turkey when
 its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by mid decade

 tajikistan economy

overview 
 tajikistan has had the lowest standard of living and now faces the bleakest
 economic prospects of the 15 former soviet republics agriculture is the
 main economic sector normally accounting for 38 of employment and
 featuring cotton and fruits industry is sparse bright spots including
 electric power and aluminum production based on the country s sizable
 hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
 metal cutting machine tools in 1991 and early 1992 disruptions in food
 supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
 throughout the republic the combination of the poor food supply the
 general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets and
 political instability have meant that the republic s leadership could make
 little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992

 thailand economy

overview 
 thailand one of the more advanced developing countries in asia enjoyed a
 year of 8 growth in 1991 although down from an annual average of 11 
 growth between 1987 and 1990 the increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
 sector benefited from export oriented investment the manufacturing and
 service sectors have accounted for the lion s share of economic growth 
 thailand s traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
 important to the overall economy in 1991 the trade deficit continued to
 increase in 1991 to 11 billion earnings from tourism and remittances grew
 marginally as a result of the gulf war and thailand s import bill grew 
 especially for manufactures and oil the government has followed fairly
 sound fiscal and monetary policies aided by increased tax receipts from the
 fast moving economy bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
 in 1991 the government is moving ahead with new projects especially for
 telecommunications roads and port facilities needed to refurbish the
 country s overtaxed infrastructure political unrest and the military s
 shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in may 1992 have caused
 international businessmen to question thailand s political stability 
 thailand s general economic outlook remains good however assuming the
 continuation of the government s progrowth measures

 trinidad and tobago economy

overview 
 trinidad and tobago s petroleum based economy began to emerge from a lengthy
 depression in 1990 and 1991 the economy fell sharply through most of the
 1980s largely because of the decline in oil prices this sector accounts
 for 80 of export earnings and more than 25 of gdp the government in
 response to the oil revenue loss pursued a series of austerity measures
 that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22 in 1988 the economy showed
 signs of recovery in 1990 however helped along by rising oil prices 
 agriculture employs only about 11 of the labor force and produces about 3 
 of gdp since this sector is small it has been unable to absorb the large
 numbers of the unemployed the government currently seeks to diversify its
 export base

 tunisia economy

overview 
 the economy depends primarily on petroleum phosphates tourism and exports
 of light manufactures following two years of drought induced economic
 decline the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
 bountiful harvest continued export growth and higher domestic investment 
 continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
 the government however and forced tunis to slow the pace of economic
 reform nonetheless the government appears committed to implementing its
 imf supported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
 debt

 turkey economy

overview 
 the impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that turkey
 launched in 1980 have begun to peter out although real growth in per capita
 gdp averaged 5 annually between 1983 and 1988 recent economic performance
 has fallen substantially moreover inflation and interest rates remain
 high and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
 country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
 to a free market economy agriculture remains an important economic sector 
 employing about half of the work force accounting for 18 of gdp and
 contributing 19 to exports the government has launched a
 multibillion dollar development program in the southeastern region which
 includes the building of a dozen dams on the tigris and euphrates rivers to
 generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland the planned
 tapping of huge additional quantities of euphrates water has raised serious
 concern in the downstream riparian nations of syria and iraq the turkish
 economy emerged from the gulf war of early 1991 in stronger shape than
 ankara had expected although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
 primarily in the politically sensitive southeast aid pledges by the
 coalition allies of more than 4 billion have helped offset the burden

 turkmenistan economy

overview 
 like the other 15 former soviet republics turkmenistan faces enormous
 problems of economic adjustment to move away from moscow based central
 planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs local
 government authorities and hopefully foreign investors this process
 requires wholesale changes in supply sources markets property rights and
 monetary arrangements industry with 10 of the labor force is heavily
 weighted toward the energy sector which produced 11 of the ex ussr s gas
 and 1 of its oil turkmenistan ranked second among the former soviet
 republics in cotton production mainly in the irrigated western region

 uganda economy

overview 
 uganda has substantial natural resources including fertile soils regular
 rainfall and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt the economy has
 been devastated by widespread political instability mismanagement and
 civil war since independence in 1962 keeping uganda poor with a per capita
 income of about 300 gdp remains below the levels of the early 1970s as
 does industrial production agriculture is the most important sector of the
 economy employing over 80 of the work force coffee is the major export
 crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues since 1986 the government
 has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
 reform raising producer prices on export crops increasing petroleum
 prices and improving civil service wages the policy changes are especially
 aimed at dampening inflation which was running at over 300 in 1987 and
 boosting production and export earnings during the period 1990 91 the
 economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
 rehabilitation of infrastructure improved incentives for production and
 exports and gradually improving domestic security

 ukraine economy

overview 
 because of its size geographic location slavic population and rich
 resources the loss of ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
 soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political 
 military and economic power of the ussr after russia the ukrainian
 republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
 former soviet union producing more than three times the output of the
 next ranking republic its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
 of soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities
 of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics likewise its
 well developed and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
 materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the ussr in
 early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
 of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
 reforms preclude a near term recovery of output

 united kingdom economy

overview 
 the uk is one of the world s great trading powers and financial centers and
 its economy ranks among the four largest in europe the economy is
 essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
 programs and government ownership prime minister major has continued the
 basic thrust of thatcher s efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
 and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector 
 agriculture is intensive highly mechanized and efficient by european
 standards producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor
 force industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises employing
 about 27 of the work force and generating 22 of gdp the uk is an
 energy rich nation with large coal natural gas and oil reserves primary
 energy production accounts for 12 of gdp one of the highest shares of any
 industrial nation in mid 1990 the economy fell into recession after eight
 years of strong economic expansion which had raised national output by one
 quarter britain s inflation rate which has been consistently well above
 those of her major trading partners declined significantly in 1991 between
 1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11 to about 6 but crept back up to
 8 in 1991 because of the economic slowdown as a major trading nation the
 uk will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession swings
 in the international oil market productivity trends in domestic industry 
 and the terms on which the economic integration of europe proceeds

 united states economy

overview 
 the us has the most powerful diverse and technologically advanced economy
 in the world with a per capita gdp of 22 470 the largest among major
 industrial nations the economy is market oriented with most decisions made
 by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
 goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace in 1989 the
 economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth the
 longest in peacetime history the expansion featured moderation in wage and
 consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5 2 of
 the labor force in 1990 however growth slowed to 1 because of a
 combination of factors such as the worldwide increase in interest rates 
 iraq s invasion of kuwait in august the subsequent spurt in oil prices and
 a general decline in business and consumer confidence in 1991 output failed
 to recover unemployment grew and signs of recovery proved premature 
 ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
 infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs and sizable budget and trade
 deficits

 uruguay economy

overview 
 the economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early 1980s 
 in 1988 real gdp grew by only 0 5 and in 1989 by 1 5 the recovery was led
 by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors agriculture alone
 contributing 20 to gdp employing about 11 of the labor force and
 generating a large proportion of export earnings raising livestock 
 particularly cattle and sheep is the major agricultural activity in 1991 
 domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990 but various government factors 
 including concentration on the external sector adverse weather conditions 
 and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
 deficit kept output from expanding rapidly in a major step toward greater
 regional economic cooperation uruguay joined brazil argentina and
 paraguay in forming the southern cone common market mercosur president
 lacalle continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
 state intervention in the economy but he faces strong opposition

 uzbekistan economy

overview 
 although uzbekistan accounted for only 3 4 of total soviet output it
 produced two thirds of the ussr s cotton moscow s push for ever increasing
 amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
 extensive environmental damage to the aral sea and rivers of the republic 
 furthermore the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
 pollution and widespread health problems recently the republic has sought
 to encourage food production at the expense of cotton the small industrial
 sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery mineral
 fertilizers vegetable oil and electrical cranes uzbekistan also has some
 important natural resources including gold about 30 of soviet production 
 uranium and natural gas the uzbek government has encouraged land reform
 but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform

 vietnam economy

overview 
 this is a formerly centrally planned developing economy with extensive
 government ownership and control of productive facilities the economy is
 primarily agricultural the sector employs about 70 of the labor force and
 accounts for half of gnp rice is the staple crop substantial amounts of
 maize sorghum cassava and sweet potatoes are also grown the government
 permits sale of surplus grain on the open market most of the mineral
 resources are located in the north including coal which is an important
 export item oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with
 production reaching 70 000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase
 in the years ahead following the end of the war in 1975 heavy handed
 government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
 agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
 north the economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
 assistance from un agencies france australia sweden and communist
 countries inflation although down from recent triple digit levels is
 still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again 
 per capita output is among the world s lowest since late 1986 the
 government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
 economic activity over to the private sector

 west bank header

note 
 the war between israel and the arab states in june 1967 ended with israel in
 control of the west bank and the gaza strip the sinai and the golan
 heights as stated in the 1978 camp david accords and reaffirmed by
 president bush s post gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the
 west bank and the gaza strip their relationship with their neighbors and a
 peace treaty between israel and jordan are to be negotiated among the
 concerned parties camp david further specifies that these negotiations will
 resolve the respective boundaries pending the completion of this process 
 it is us policy that the final status of the west bank and the gaza strip
 has yet to be determined in the view of the us the term west bank
 describes all of the area west of the jordan river under jordanian
 administration before the 1967 arab israeli war however with respect to
 negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is us policy that a
 distinction must be made between jerusalem and the rest of the west bank
 because of the city s special status and circumstances therefore a
 negotiated solution for the final status of jerusalem could be different in
 character from that of the rest of the west bank

 west bank economy

overview 
 economic progress in the west bank has been hampered by israeli military
 administration and the effects of the palestinian uprising intifadah 
 industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
 been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive israeli
 policies capital investment consists largely of residential housing not
 productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with israeli
 industry a major share of gnp is derived from remittances of workers
 employed in israel and persian gulf states but such transfers from the gulf
 dropped dramatically after iraq invaded kuwait in august 1990 in the wake
 of the persian gulf crisis many palestinians have returned to the west
 bank increasing unemployment and export revenues have plunged because of
 the loss of markets in jordan and the gulf states israeli measures to
 curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
 standards the area s economic outlook remains bleak

overview 
 aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1 3 in contrast to estimated
 2 growth in 1990 and 3 growth in 1989 in 1991 the developed countries
 grew by 2 5 and the ldcs by 3 5 these gains being offset by a 10 15 drop
 in the former communist dominated areas of the ussr and eastern europe as
 usual results among individual countries differed widely in the developed
 group japan led with 4 5 the west european members averaged 1 2 and the
 recession plagued united states lagged with gdp down 0 7 as for the 15
 former soviet republics and the seven nations of eastern europe output
 plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
 rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange china and
 the four dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
 countries are mired in poverty and political instability for the world as a
 whole the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
 overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution

industries 
 industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology especially in
 computers robotics telecommunications and medicines and medical
 equipment most of these advances take place in oecd nations only a small
 portion of non oecd countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
 technological forces and the technological gap between the industrial
 nations and the less developed countries continues to widen the rapid
 development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
 already grim environmental problems

 world economy

agriculture 
 the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
 20 years the annual production of cereals for instance has risen by 50 
 from about 1 2 billion metric tons to about 1 8 billion metric tons 
 production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
 increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
 aggregate demand about one fifth of the world s population remains
 malnourished primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
 for large and rapidly growing populations which are too poor to pay for
 food imports conditions are especially bad in africa where drought in
 recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors

 yemen economy

overview 
 whereas the northern city sanaa is the political capital of a united yemen 
 the southern city aden with its refinery and port facilities is the
 economic and commercial capital future economic development depends heavily
 on western assisted development of promising oil resources south yemen s
 willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in soviet
 economic support 
overview 
 north 
 the low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern yemen
 dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs large trade
 deficits have been made up for by remittances from yemenis working abroad
 and foreign aid once self sufficient in food production northern yemen has
 become a major importer land once used for export crops cotton fruit 
 and vegetables has been turned over to growing qat a mildly narcotic
 shrub chewed by yemenis which has no significant export market oil export
 revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about
 800 million 
 south 
 this has been one of the poorest arab countries with a per capita gnp of
 about 500 a shortage of natural resources a widely dispersed population 
 and an arid climate have made economic development difficult the economy
 has grown at an average annual rate of only 2 3 since the mid 1970s the
 economy had been organized along socialist lines dominated by the public
 sector economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives partly
 stemming from centralized control over production decisions investment
 allocation and import choices

 only 5 of both gdp and employment but supplies of minerals and metals

gnp gdp methodology in the economy section gnp gdp dollar estimates for
the oecd countries the former soviet republics and the east european
countries are derived from purchasing power parity ppp calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates the ppp method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy 
in addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing
for the quality of goods and services the division of a ppp gnp gdp estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the ppp
conversion rate one thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the us as one thousand dollars converted to the local currency at the ppp
conversion rate will buy in the other country gnp gdp estimates for the
ldcs on the other hand are based on the conversion of gnp gdp estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates one
caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of gnp gdp
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
gnp gdp accounts are expressed in ppp terms as for example when an observer
estimates the dollar level of russian or japanese military expenditures 
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures finally as academic research moves forward on the
ppp method we hope to convert all gnp gdp estimates to this method in future

captive register a register of ships maintained by a territory possession 
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent
of an internal register ships on a captive register will fly the same flag
as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory although the
nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be
owned abroad the captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register except that it is not the register of an independent state 

flag of convenience register a national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state the major flags of convenience
 foc attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or
nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements true foc
registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered
actually owned in the flag state thus while virtually any flag can be used
for ships under a given set of circumstances an foc register is one where
the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad 
it is also referred to as an open register 

flag state the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad 
differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned
and taxed and whether a foreign owned ship may be placed on the register 

internal register a register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register these differences usually include lower taxation
of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the
flag state when it functions as an foc register the norwegian international
ship register and danish international ship register are the most notable
examples of an internal register 
both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to
flags of convenience and in attracting foreign owned ships to the norwegian
and danish flags 

merchant ship a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight 
commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to
commercial vessels only 

register the record of a ship s ownership and nationality as listed with
the maritime authorities of a country also the compendium of such individual
ships registrations registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
